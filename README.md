# SkolaR

SkolaR is a management system for schools targeted toward teachers for recording feedback about students, and for parents to have access to that feedback.
What is the reason for starting this project?

- I started this project because I felt that I should contribute to Open Source, but also I wanted to have a side project which I can invest my time into and possibly stumble upon problems which need solving, which I do not have a chance to work on at my daily work routine. I believe this will push me to invest my time into learning new stuff, thinking outside the box and make continous development of my career.
